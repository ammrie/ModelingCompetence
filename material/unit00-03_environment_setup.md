We value freedom of choice as an important good but giving our long-term experience freedom of choice comes to an end when we talk about the mandatory working environment for this course. The reason for this is simple: you work with assignments and a piece of code or text written on the laptop of person A should run basically without any changes on the computer of person B. Hence, let's save everybody's time and focus on the things which are really important. Once the course is finished, feel free to use any working environment structure you like.
